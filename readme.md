Entertainment App
Welcome to our Entertainment App project! This repository contains both the frontend and backend code for our application. The frontend is built using React with Vite and Tailwind CSS, while the backend is built with Node.js using Express, Axios, Crocs, JWT for authentication, Mongoose for MongoDB database interaction, and Nodemon for automatic server restarts during development.

The deployment process flow consists of 6 steps:-

1. Install Vercel CLI: If you haven't already, install the Vercel CLI globally by running:-
   npm install -g vercel

2.Login to Vercel: Log in to your Vercel account using the CLI:-
  vercel login

.3 Deploy: Navigate to your frontend directory and deploy your application using the 'vercel' command:-
  cd frontend
  vercel
  
4. Follow Prompts: Follow the prompts in the CLI to set up your deployment. You might be asked to provide your project name, and Vercel will handle the deployment process for you.
5. Access Your Deployment: Once the deployment process is complete, Vercel will provide you with a URL where your application is hosted.
6. Custom Domain (Optional): If you have a custom domain, you can set it up through the Vercel dashboard or CLI.

Remember to configure your backend deployment separately if you're hosting it on a different platform like Heroku or Vercel Functions. If you're using Vercel Functions for your backend, you can follow similar steps to deploy it using the Vercel CLI.
